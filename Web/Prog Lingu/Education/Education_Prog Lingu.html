                    <div> Working on the different languages even those involved in programming, 
                        getting the structure that is found in the implementation of operating systems and hardware configurations, 
                        understanding the basis of networking, this has brought up a good knowledge of whats ahead in the world like AI. 
                        The mathematics that is brought up in the study of systems and the influence of music theory that I am improving on, 
                        this has created opportunities to manage both talent and career choice. 
                        I estimate that this is a good scope or maybe an overview of what I am capable of operating though not all.
